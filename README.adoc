== HiveMQ extension for ACE
=== Overview
This extension implements the mqtt-tls profile for ACE (Authorization and Authentication in Constrained Environments) described https://art.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sengul-ace-mqtt-tls-profile-04[here].

=== Constituents
This extension has the following dependencies:

- A modified version of the HiveMQ CE because currently the official broker doesn't expose the extended authentication features to extensions. There is an implementation https://github.com/michaelg9/hivemq-community-edition[here]
- A fully v5 compliant MQTT client that supports ACE, which can be found https://github.com/michaelg9/HiveACEclient[here]
- An ACE authorization server running OAuth2, which can be found https://github.com/nominetresearch/ace-mqtt-mosquitto[here]

=== Build Instructions

Coming soon
